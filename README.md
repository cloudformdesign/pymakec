# pymakec -- python make C

pymakec is a package to allow for making simple make files with python. It is pronounced
as a question: “py make see?” as in, “can python make c?”

It was born of a frustration with learning a new language just to script a “cc CFLAGS ...”
call with a bunch of objects. It is 2015 -- we can do so much better

In essence you just define a `make.py` file in your root directory and call `pymake` from
the shell. pymakec has all the tools you need to easily create a full fleged make file
and run tests -- horray!

pymakec is still in development. Full documentation on how to use will be available
when it has been used more by the author.
